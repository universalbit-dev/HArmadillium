#### 6to4 IPv6 Tunneling [Why?](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2013/ipv6-address-planning-guidelines-for-ipv6-address-allocation/)

* ##### Enable operation for both internet protocols IPv4/IPv6 
Internet Protocol: IPv4 <===> IPV6
* [Test your IPV6 Connectivity](https://test-ipv6.com/)

##### Example Details of test
```
Test with IPv4 DNS record	 	
ok (0.194s) using ipv4
Test with IPv6 DNS record	 	
timeout (15.017s)
Test with Dual Stack DNS record	
ok (0.486s) using ipv4
Test for Dual Stack DNS and large packet	 	
ok (0.428s) using ipv4
Test IPv6 large packet	 	
timeout (15.011s)
Test if your ISP's DNS server uses IPv6	 	
ok (0.539s) using ipv4
Find IPv4 Service Provider	 	
ok (0.437s) using ipv4 ASN 3269
Find IPv6 Service Provider	 	
timeout (15.003s)
```

Miredo Available for : Linux/Windows/MacOs

Miredo open-source package
* [Git](https://github.com/wosk/miredo)
* [WebSite](https://www.remlab.net/miredo/)

- Introduction:
miredo is an open-source implementation of the Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through NATs Internet proposed standard (RFC 4380), targetting the Linux kernel and BSD operating systems. The purpose of Teredo IPv6 tunneling is to provide IPv6 connectivity to users behind NAT devices, such as most broadband routers, most of which do not support IPv6. 

* Ubuntu/Debian Installation
```
sudo apt install miredo miredo-server
``` 

- Setup [Static IPv4](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/add-configure-set-up-static-ip-address-on-debianlinux/)
- Install miredo and miredo-server
- Create NetWork Interface
- Edit miredo configuration file
- Edit miredo-server configuration file
- Network Connections (Shared to other computers) [experimental]

##### Create 6to4 network interfaces:
```
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

```
auto 6to4
iface 6to4 inet6 6to4
        local 192.168.2.3 # <== your static local ip 
```

##### Configuration miredo package:
```
nano /etc/miredo
```

```
InterfaceName   6to4
ServerAddress 192.168.2.3 # <== your static local ip
BindPort  3544
```
##### Configuration miredo-server:

- miredo-server is an Unix daemon program which implements a Teredo server as specified by the "Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through NATs"
```
nano /etc/miredo-server.conf
```
```
ServerBindAddress 192.168.2.3 # <===
```

Enabled Miredo and Miredo-Server Running on System Boot:
```
nano /etc/default/miredo
```

```
# Defaults for miredo initscript
# sourced by /etc/init.d/miredo
# installed at /etc/default/miredo by the maintainer scripts
# This is a POSIX shell fragment
# Comment out not to start miredo on system startup
START_MIREDO=true
# Additional options that are passed to the Daemon.
DAEMON_ARGS=""
```

```
nano /etc/default/miredo-server
```

```
# Defaults for miredo-server initscript
# sourced by /etc/init.d/miredo-server
# installed at /etc/default/miredo-server by the maintainer scripts
# This is a POSIX shell fragment
# Uncomment to start miredo-server on system startup
START_MIREDO_SERVER=true
# Additional options that are passed to the Daemon.
DAEMON_ARGS="-u miredo-server"
```


```
sudo service miredo start
sudo service miredo-server start
```
